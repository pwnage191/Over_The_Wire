## Challenge:
Start here:
Username: natas5
Password: ( Password obtained from previous level ) 
URL:      http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org 

## My path: 
  - I opened the website & login by using username and password.
  - The web paged showed "Access disallowed. You are not logged in".
  - I used burp suite to intercept the request.
  - In cookies header, there is one field called loggedin=0.
  - I changed to loggedin=1.
  - Permission granted for that webpage and revealed the next level password.

## Learning outcomes:
  - Learned that login state can be tracked using cookies.
  - Observed that cookie values can be modified by the client.
  - Saw how weak server-side validation leads to authorization bypass.

## Real world mapping:
  - Websites sometimes rely on insecure cookies to identify logged-in users.
  - Attackers can manipulate cookies to escalate privileges or bypass authentication.

## Bug class:
  - Improper Access Control – trusting client-side cookie values.
  - Broken Authentication – login state not validated server-side.

## Conclusion:
By intercepting the request and modifying the cookie value from loggedin=0 to loggedin=1, the server granted access and revealed 
the password, demonstrating how insecure cookie-based authorization can be manipulated to bypass security in real systems.
