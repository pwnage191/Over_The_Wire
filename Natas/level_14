## Challenge:
Start here:
Username: natas14
Password: ( Password obtained from previous level ) 
URL:      http://natas14.natas.labs.overthewire.org 

## My path: 
  - I opened the website.
  - It asked the user to enter the username and password.
  - First I tried random username and password, I tried to know sql injection is exist or not.
  - I tried single quote and then double quotes, when I try double quotes, it showed the error.
  - It displayed mysqli_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be mysqli_result. It is MYSQL database.
  - Next, I saw the source code link.
  - It contained, " "SELECT * from users where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\" and password=\"".$_REQUEST["password"]."\"";".
       if(mysqli_num_rows(mysqli_query($link, $query)) > 0) {
            echo "Successful login! The password for natas15 is <censored><br>";
  - The application only checks whether the database returned at least one row, if yes, login succeeds and the next level password is 
    shown, if no, access is denied.
  - Rows are returned not because usernames match, but because the WHERE condition evaluates to TRUE for that row.
  - My payload works by changing the database’s check so the condition becomes always true, causing it to return
    a row even though the username and password are wrong.
  - Payload: admin" OR "1"="1" -- " 
  - I give a wrong value in one part, inject a condition 1=1 using OR, and comment out the rest.
  - It revealed the next level password.

## Learning Outcomes:
  - Understood how SQL checks conditions as true or false.
  - Learned how changing logic can bypass authentication.
  - Developed the mindset of attacking logic, not values.

## Real-World Mapping:
  - This vulnerability appears in login pages of real websites.
  - Attackers can log in without valid credentials.
  - No input validation are used.

## Bug Class:
  - SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)
  - User input changes the SQL logic so the login condition always evaluates to true.

## Conclusion:
  - The application trusted user input and only checked if the database returned a row.
  - By forcing the SQL condition to be true, authentication was bypassed.
  - This level teaches the core foundation of SQL injection logic.
