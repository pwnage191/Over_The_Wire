Username: natas1

URL:      http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org 

## My Path:
Method 1:
  - I opened the website.
  - It shows "You can find the password for the next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!"
  - I tried to right-click, but a popup displayed "right clicking has been blocked!".
  - I searched for a shortcut for right‑click on Google, and it showed Shift + F10.
  - It didn’t work.
  - Next, I used the shortcut for view page source (Ctrl + U).
  - It worked. One of the comments held the password for the next level.

Method 2:
  - I used the key "F12" to open the dev tools.
  - Go to the elements tab, see the code, One of the comments held the password for the next level.

Method 3:
  - I use Google to know how to unblock the right-click.
  - Open DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
  - Open DevTools settings (gear icon or F1).
  - Disable JavaScript in the settings panel.
  - Reload the page to bypass the right-click block.
  - Now, it allows you to right-click.
