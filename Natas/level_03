## Challenge:
Start here:
Username: natas3
Password: ( Password obtained from previous level ) 
URL:      http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org 

## My path: 
  - I opened the website, it shows "There is nothing on this page" in the main page.
  - I visited the view page source, one of the comments shows "<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->".
  - I used google search to understand the clue meaning.
  - The clue <!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... --> in a CTF challenge is a strong
    hint to investigate the robots.txt file. 
  - I went to the "/robots.txt", It displayed "Disallow: /s3cr3t/".
  - I visited that directory, it revealed the file name "users.txt".
  - It contained the password for the next level.

## Learning Outcomes
  - Identified robots.txt as a place to discover restricted paths.
  - Recognized that disallowed paths can still be accessed manually.

## Real-World Mapping
  - robots.txt can unintentionally expose sensitive directories to attackers.
  - Disallow rules only guide crawlers; they do not enforce security.

## Bug Class
  - Information Disclosure – sensitive paths and data revealed.
  - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR-like access) – accessing files directly without restrictions.
  - Improper Access Control – directories allowed public access.

## Conclusion
A clue in the source led to robots.txt, which exposed a hidden directory containing a file with the next password,
demonstrating how poor access control and exposed paths can leak sensitive information.
