## Challenge:
Start here:
Username: natas2
Password: ( Password obtained from previous level ) 
URL:      http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org 

## My path: 
  - I opened the website, it shows "There is nothing on this page".
  - I opened view page source, I saw the image url, clicked it.
  - I tried zooming in on the image, thinking there may be hidden information.
  - I tried downloading the image through terminal commands, but it failed.
  - Later, I noticed the path when I clicked the image URL.
  - It has "files/pixel.png" and realised that there is a directory called "files".
  - I went to the parent directory, it showed the list of file names. One of the file names was "users.txt".
  - The file contains the password for the next level.

## Learning Outcomes:
  - Identified file paths in URLs as clues.
  - Navigated directories manually to access files.
  - Found sensitive data inside publicly accessible files.

## Real-World Mapping:
  - Directory listing can expose sensitive information.
  - URLs and file paths can reveal server structure.
 
## Bug class:
  - Directory Listing / Directory Browsing enabled – the server allows users to view internal folder contents.
  - Information Disclosure – sensitive information becomes visible to users who shouldn’t see it.

## Conclusion: 
Discovering hidden directories and exposed files revealed the sensitive informations, demonstrating how simple misconfigurations 
can lead to information disclosure.
