## Challenge:
Start here:
Username: natas9
Password: ( Password obtained from previous level ) 
URL:      http://natas9.natas.labs.overthewire.org 

## My path: 
  - I opened the website.
  - It had an input box, asking you to enter the "Find words containing" & also had the view page source.
  - I clicked the view page source. It contained the php logic code.
  - It contained the file name dictionary.txt, i opened that file, it had the list of words.
  - In the code, I saw the line "passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");".
  - I used Google to learn that passthru executes system commands, similar to exec().
  - So, it is a command line injection.
  - Case 1:
      When I entered the "hello" into the input, the program executes "grep -i hello dictionary.txt".
      This searches for the word "hello" (case‑insensitive) inside dictionary.txt and prints matching lines.
  - Case 2:
      When I entered the "cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10", It only takes cat to search inside the dictionary.txt, 
      and showed the matching letter.because the input is appended directly after grep, not executed as a separate command.
  - Case 3:
      So, When I entered hello;cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10, the php code executes two separate commands,
      grep -i hello dictionary.txt; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10.
  - It revealed the password for the next level.

## Learning Outcomes:
  - Understand how unsanitized input reaches system commands.
  - Learn that passthru() executes OS commands on the server.
  - See how command injection works using ; to chain commands.

## Real‑World Mapping:
  - Attackers inject commands into poorly validated parameters.
  - Similar issues appear in search boxes, file imports.

## Bug Class:
  - Command Injection: User input is executed as system commands instead of treated as plain data.

## Conclusion:
This challenge shows why user input must be sanitized before executing commands.
Even simple concatenation of input to shell commands can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands and steal sensitive files.
